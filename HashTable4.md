## [3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-elements-with-maximum-frequency/)  1216

- [Official](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-elements-with-maximum-frequency/editorial/)

<details><summary>Description</summary>

```text
You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.

Return the total frequencies of elements in nums such that those elements all have the maximum frequency.

The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
```

<details><summary>Description</summary>

```text
You are given a string word and an integer k.

We consider word to be k-special if |freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| <= k for all indices i and j in the string.

Here, freq(x) denotes the frequency of the character x in word, and |y| denotes the absolute value of y.

Return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make word k-special.

Example 1:
Input: word = "aabcaba", k = 0
Output: 3
Explanation: We can make word 0-special by deleting 2 occurrences of "a" and 1 occurrence of "c".
Therefore, word becomes equal to "baba" where freq('a') == freq('b') == 2.

Example 2:
Input: word = "dabdcbdcdcd", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "a" and 1 occurrence of "d".
Therefore, word becomes equal to "bdcbdcdcd" where freq('b') == 2, freq('c') == 3, and freq('d') == 4.

Example 3:
Input: word = "aaabaaa", k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "b".
Therefore, word becomes equal to "aaaaaa" where each letter's frequency is now uniformly 6.

Constraints:
1 <= word.length <= 10^5
0 <= k <= 10^5
word consists only of lowercase English letters.
```

<details><summary>Hint</summary>

```text
1. Count the frequency of each letter.
2. Suppose we select several characters as the final answer,
   and let x be the character with the smallest frequency in the answer.
   It can be shown that out of the selected characters,
   the optimal solution will never delete an occurrence of character x to obtain the answer.
3. We will fix a character c and assume that it will be the character with the smallest frequency in the answer.
   Suppose its frequency is x.
4. Then, for every other character, we will count the number of occurrences that will be deleted.
   Suppose that the current character has y occurrences.
   - If y < x, we need to delete all of them.
   - if y > x + k, we should delete y - x - k of such character.
   - Otherwise we donâ€™t need to delete it.

## [3160. Find the Number of Distinct Colors Among the Balls](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-distinct-colors-among-the-balls/)  1517

- [Official](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-distinct-colors-among-the-balls/editorial/)

<details><summary>Description</summary>

```text
You are given an integer limit and a 2D array queries of size n x 2.

There are limit + 1 balls with distinct labels in the range [0, limit].
Initially, all balls are uncolored.
For every query in queries that is of the form [x, y], you mark ball x with the color y.
After each query, you need to find the number of distinct colors among the balls.

Return an array result of length n, where result[i] denotes the number of distinct colors after ith query.

Note that when answering a query, lack of a color will not be considered as a color.

Example 1:
Input: limit = 4, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[1,3],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,2,3]
Explanation:
After query 0, ball 1 has color 4.
After query 1, ball 1 has color 4, and ball 2 has color 5.
After query 2, ball 1 has color 3, and ball 2 has color 5.
After query 3, ball 1 has color 3, ball 2 has color 5, and ball 3 has color 4.

Example 2:
Input: limit = 4, queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,2],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: [1,2,2,3,4]
Explanation:
After query 0, ball 0 has color 1.
After query 1, ball 0 has color 1, and ball 1 has color 2.
After query 2, ball 0 has color 1, and balls 1 and 2 have color 2.
After query 3, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, and ball 3 has color 4.
After query 4, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, ball 3 has color 4, and ball 4 has color 5.

Constraints:
1 <= limit <= 109
1 <= n == queries.length <= 10^5
queries[i].length == 2
0 <= queries[i][0] <= limit
1 <= queries[i][1] <= 10^9

<details><summary>Description</summary>

```text
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

An integer h is called valid if all values in the array that are strictly greater than h are identical.

For example, if nums = [10, 8, 10, 8], a valid integer is h = 9 because all nums[i] > 9 are equal to 10,
but 5 is not a valid integer.

You are allowed to perform the following operation on nums:
- Select an integer h that is valid for the current values in nums.
- For each index i where nums[i] > h, set nums[i] to h.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make every element in nums equal to k.
If it is impossible to make all elements equal to k, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,2,5,4,5], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:
The operations can be performed in order using valid integers 4 and then 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,1,2], k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation:
It is impossible to make all the values equal to 2.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [9,7,5,3], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
The operations can be performed using valid integers in the order 7, 5, 3, and 1.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= k <= 100
```

<details><summary>Hint</summary>

```text
1. Handle the case when the array contains an integer less than k
2. Start by performing operations on the highest integer
3. You can perform an operation on the highest integer using the second-highest,
   an operation on the second-highest using the third-highest, and so forth.
4. The answer is the number of distinct integers in the array that are larger than k.

<details><summary>Description</summary>

```text
You are given an integer array nums. You need to ensure that the elements in the array are distinct.
To achieve this, you can perform the following operation any number of times:
- Remove 3 elements from the beginning of the array.
  If the array has fewer than 3 elements, remove all remaining elements.

Note that an empty array is considered to have distinct elements.
Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the elements in the array distinct.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,2,3,3,5,7]
Output: 2
Explanation:
In the first operation, the first 3 elements are removed, resulting in the array [4, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7].
In the second operation, the next 3 elements are removed, resulting in the array [3, 5, 7], which has distinct elements.
Therefore, the answer is 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,4,4]
Output: 2
Explanation:
In the first operation, the first 3 elements are removed, resulting in the array [4, 4].
In the second operation, all remaining elements are removed, resulting in an empty array.
Therefore, the answer is 2.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [6,7,8,9]
Output: 0
Explanation:
The array already contains distinct elements. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

<details><summary>Description</summary>

```text
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z').

Your task is to:
- Find the vowel (one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u') with the maximum frequency.
- Find the consonant (all other letters excluding vowels) with the maximum frequency.

Return the sum of the two frequencies.

Note:
If multiple vowels or consonants have the same maximum frequency, you may choose any one of them.
If there are no vowels or no consonants in the string, consider their frequency as 0.

The frequency of a letter x is the number of times it occurs in the string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "successes"
Output: 6
Explanation:
The vowels are: 'u' (frequency 1), 'e' (frequency 2). The maximum frequency is 2.
The consonants are: 's' (frequency 4), 'c' (frequency 2). The maximum frequency is 4.
The output is 2 + 4 = 6.

Example 2:
Input: s = "aeiaeia"
Output: 3
Explanation:
The vowels are: 'a' (frequency 3), 'e' ( frequency 2), 'i' (frequency 2). The maximum frequency is 3.
There are no consonants in s. Hence, maximum consonant frequency = 0.
The output is 3 + 0 = 3.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists of lowercase English letters only.
